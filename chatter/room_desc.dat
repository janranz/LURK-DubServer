This is the portal room. The humble chamber of all good things. Go wherever your heart desires, or start off at the beginning.
A crack in the ceiling above the middle of the north wall allows a trickle of water to flow down to the floor.
Thick cobwebs fill the corners of the room, and wisps of webbing hang from the ceiling and waver in a wind you can barely feel.
Tapestries decorate the walls of this room. Although they may once have been brilliant in hue, they now hang in graying tatters.
Rats inside the room shriek when they hear the door open, then they run in all directions from a putrid corpse lying in the center of the floor.
Neither light nor darkvision can penetrate the gloom in this chamber. An unnatural shade fills it, and the room's farthest reaches are barely visible.
Burning torches in iron sconces line the walls of this room, lighting it brilliantly. At the room's center lies a squat stone altar, its top covered in recently spilled blood.
A liquid-filled pit extends to every wall of this chamber. The liquid lies about 10 feet below your feet and is so murky that you can't see its bottom.
Fire crackles and pops in a small cooking fire set in the center of the room. The smoke from a burning rat on a spit curls up through a hole in the ceiling.
A flurry of bats suddenly flaps through the doorway, their screeching barely audible as they careen past your heads.
Rusting spikes line the walls and ceiling of this chamber. The dusty floor shows no sign that the walls move over it, but you can see the skeleton of some humanoid impaled on some wall spikes nearby.
You open the door, and the reek of garbage assaults your nose. Looking inside, you see a pile of refuse and offal that nearly reaches the ceiling.
You open the door, and the room comes alive with light and music. A sourceless, warm glow suffuses the chamber, and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds.
A skeleton dressed in moth-eaten garb lies before a large open chest in the rear of this chamber. The chest is empty, but you note two needles projecting from the now-open lock.
Rounded green stones set in the floor form a snake's head that points in the direction of the doorway you stand in.
The manacles set into the walls of this room give you the distinct impression that it was used as a prison and torture chamber, although you can see no evidence of torture devices.
You gaze into the room and hundreds of skulls gaze coldly back at you. They're set in niches in the walls in a checkerboard pattern, each skull bearing a half-melted candle on its head.
Unlike the flagstone common throughout the dungeon, this room is walled and floored with black marble veined with white.
A huge iron cage lies on its side in this room, and its gate rests open on the floor. A broken chain lies under the door, and the cage is on a rotting corpse that looks to be a hobgoblin.
This room is a tomb. Stone sarcophagi stand in five rows of three, each carved with the visage of a warrior lying in state.
A dim bluish light suffuses this chamber, its source obvious at a glance. Blue-glowing lichen and violet-glowing moss cling to the ceiling and spread across the floor.
You open the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling, and each hole is roughly a foot wide.
This room smells strange, no doubt due to the weird sheets of black slime that drip from cracks in the ceiling and spread across the floor.
This room is hung with hundreds of dusty tapestries. All show signs of wear: moth holes, scorch marks, dark stains, and the damage of years of neglect.
You catch a whiff of the unmistakable metallic tang of blood as you open the door. The floor is covered with it, and splashes of blood spatter the walls.
Three low, oblong piles of rubble lie near the center of this small room. Each has a weapon jutting upright from one end -- a longsword, a spear, and a quarterstaff.
Huge rusted metal blades jut out of cracks in the walls, and rusting spikes project down from the ceiling almost to the floor.
Several round pits lie in the floor of the room before you. Spaced roughly equally apart, each is about 15 feet in diameter and appears about 20 feet deep.
Many doors fill the room ahead. Doors of varied shape, size, and design are set in every wall and even the ceiling and floor.
A strange ceiling is the focal point of the room before you. It's honeycombed with hundreds of holes about as wide as your head.
This chamber was clearly smaller at one time, but something knocked down the wall that separated it from an adjacent room.
A chill wind blows against you as you open the door. Beyond it, you see that the floor and ceiling are nothing but iron grates.
This room is shattered. A huge crevasse shears the chamber in half, and the ground and ceilings are tilted away from it.
A pit yawns open before you just on the other side of the door's threshold. The entire floor of the room has fallen into a second room beneath it.
As the door opens, it scrapes up frost from a floor covered in ice. The room before you looks like an ice cave.
A 30-foot-tall demonic idol dominates this room of black stone. The potbellied statue is made of red stone, and its grinning face holds what looks to be two large rubies in place of eyes.
Several exits lead from this room, but only one is within the mouth of a man. The door opposite you stands within an intricate stone carving of a man's wide-open mouth.
The door creaks open, which somewhat overshadows the sound of bubbling liquid. Before you is a room about which alchemists dream.
The scent of earthy decay assaults your nose upon peering through the open door to this room. Smashed bookcases and their sundered contents litter the floor.
Several white marble busts that rest on white pillars dominate this room. Most appear to be male or female humans of middle age, but one clearly bears small horns projecting from its forehead and another is spread across the floor in a thousand pieces, leaving one pillar empty.
A dozen statues stand or kneel in this room, and each one lacks a head and stands in a posture of action or defense.
A rusted portcullis stands just beyond the door. Looking into the room, you see three other exits, similarly blocked by portcullises.
This tiny room holds a curious array of machinery. Winches and levers project from every wall, and chains with handles dangle from the ceiling.
This narrow room at first appears to be a dead-end corridor, but then you note several metal plates on the walls set at about eye height.
You open the door to a scene of carnage. Two male humans, a male elf, and a female dwarf lie in drying pools of their blood.
The door in front of you seems to be stuck.\sNote: If the PCs yank it open, it comes open. Read the following: A furious rumble resounds in the area as stones come clattering through the doorway, along with a thick cloud of rock dust.
This chamber served as an armory for some group of creatures. Armor and weapon racks line the walls and rusty and broken weapons litter the floor.
There's a hiss as you open this door, and you smell a sour odor, like something rotten or fermented. Inside you see a small room lined with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels.
A horrendous, overwhelming stench wafts from the room before you. Small cages containing small animals and large insects line the walls.
A cluster of low crates surrounds a barrel in the center of this chamber. Atop the barrel lies a stack of copper coins and two stacks of cards, one face up.
This chamber of well-laid stones holds a wide bas-relief of a pastoral scene. In it you see a mountain like Mount Waterdeep, except that Castle Waterdeep and the city are missing.
A stone throne stands on a foot-high circular dais in the center of this cold chamber. The throne and dais bear the simple adornments of patterns of crossed lines -- a pattern also employed around each door to the room.
A wall that holds a seat with a hole in it is in this chamber. It's a privy! The noisome stench from the hole leads you to believe that the privy sees regular use.
The burble of water reaches your ears after you open the door to this room. You see the source of the noise in the far wall: a large fountain artfully carved to look like a seashell with the figure of a seacat spewing clear water into its basin.
This room holds six dry circular basins large enough to hold a man and a dry fountain at its center. All possess chipped carvings of merfolk and other sea creatures.
A glow escapes this room through its open doorways. The masonry between every stone emanates an unnatural orange radiance.
A huge stewpot hangs from a thick iron tripod over a crackling fire in the center of this chamber. A hole in the ceiling allows some of the smoke from the fire to escape, but much of it expands across the ceiling and rolls down to fill the room in a dark fog.
You've opened the door to a torture chamber. Several devices of degradation, pain, and death stand about the room, all of them showing signs of regular use.
This short hall leads to another door. On either side of the hall, niches are set into the wall within which stand clay urns.
Corpses and pieces of corpses hang from hooks that dangle from chains attached to thick iron rings. Most appear humanoid but a few of the body parts appear more monstrous.
This small chamber seems divided into three parts. The first has several hooks on the walls from which hang dusty robes.
When looking into this chamber, you're confronted by a thousand reflections of yourself looking back.
A large forge squats against the far wall of this room, and coals glow dimly inside. Before the forge stands a wide block of iron with a heavy-looking hammer lying atop it, no doubt for use in pounding out shapes in hot metal.
This chamber is clearly a prison. Small barred cells line the walls, leaving a 15-foot-wide pathway for a guard to walk.
You push open the stone door to this room and note that the only other exit is a door made of wood. It and the table shoved against it are warped and swollen.
This otherwise bare room has one distinguishing feature. The stone around one of the other doors has been pulled over its edges, as though the rock were as soft as clay and could be moved with fingers.
You enter a small room and your steps echo. Looking about, you're uncertain why, but then a wall vanishes and reveals an enormous chamber.
You feel a sense of foreboding upon peering into this cavernous chamber. At its center lies a low heap of refuse, rubble, and bones atop which sit several huge broken eggshells.
This small chamber is a bloody mess. The corpse of a minotaur lies on the floor, its belly carved out.
A chill crawls up your spine and out over your skin as you look upon this room. The carvings on the wall are magnificent, a symphony in stonework -- but given the themes represented, it might be better described as a requiem.
A pungent, earthy odor greets you as you pull open the door and peer into this room. Mushrooms grow in clusters of hundreds all over the floor.
You pull open the door and hear the scrape of its opening echo throughout what must be a massive room.
You find this chamber lit dimly by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax. The smell of their smoke hits your nose along with an odor that is reminiscent of the sea.
This chamber holds one occupant: the statue of a male figure with elven features but the broad, muscular body of a hale human.
The door to this room swings open easily on well-oiled hinges. Beyond it you see that the chamber walls have been disguised by wood paneling, and the stone ceiling and floor are hidden by bright marble tiles.
Many small desks with high-backed chairs stand in three long rows in this room. Each desk has an inkwell, book stand, and a partially melted candle in a rusting tin candleholder.
You round the corner to see a ghastly scene. A semitranslucent figure hangs in the air, studded with crossbow bolts and with blood pouring from every wound.
You open the door and before you is a dragon's hoard of treasure. Coins cover every inch of the room, and jeweled objects of precious metal jut up from the money like glittering islands in a sea of gold.
You open the door to reveal a 10-foot-by-10-foot room with a floor studded with spikes. The bones of some creature lie among the spikes and some insects scuttle away from the desiccated remains.
You open the door to a long narrow room with a high ceiling. Three thick circles of wood rest on wooden stands.
You open the door to what must be a combat training room. Rough fighting circles are scratched into the surface of the floor.
This small room contains several pieces of well-polished wood furniture. Eight ornate, high-backed chairs surround a long oval table, and a side table stands next to the far exit.
The strong, sour-sweet scent of vinegar assaults your nose as you enter this room. Sundered casks and broken bottle glass line the walls of this room.
Looking into this room, you note four pits in the floor. A wide square is nearest you, a triangular pit beyond it, and a little farther than both lie two circular pits.
This room looks like it was designed by drow. Rusted metal tiles create a huge mosaic of a spider in the floor, and someone set up rusted gratings like draperies of webs.
You peer through the open doorway into a broad, pillared hall. The columns of stone are carved as tree trunks and seem placed at random like trees in a forest.
This small room is lined with benchlike seats on all the walls. The seats all have holes in their top, like a privy.
In the center of this large room lies a 30-foot-wide round pit, its edges lined with rusting iron spikes.
This room is a small antechamber before two titanic bronze doors. Each stands 20 feet tall and is about 7 feet wide.
You poke your head through the break in the wall and look upon a room of titanic size. It is clearly an enormous mausoleum built to the proportions of giants.
This chamber holds an odd contraption of metal and wood. It's a 20-foot-diameter circular platform that is tilted heavily to one side.
You inhale a briny smell like the sea as you crack open the door to this chamber. Within you spy the source of the scent: a dark and still pool of brackish water within a low circular wall.
Stinking smoke wafts up from braziers made of skulls set around the edges of this room. The walls bear scratch marks and lines of soot that form crude pictures and what looks like words in some language [Goblin].
This small bare chamber holds nothing but a large ironbound chest, which is big enough for a man to fit in and bears a heavy iron lock.
This hall is choked with corpses. The bodies of orcs and ogres lie in tangled heaps where they died, and the floor is sticky with dried blood.
You round the corner of the hall to confront a passage nearly blocked with crates, barrels, and chests.
You smelled smoke as you moved down the hall, and rounding the corner into this room you see why. Every surface bears scorch marks and ash piles on the floor.
This hall stinks with the wet, pungent scent of mildew. Black mold grows in tangled veins across the walls and parts of the floor.
You open the door and a gout of flame rushes at your face. A wave of heat strikes you at the same time and light fills the hall.
You peer into this room and spot the white orb of a skull lying on the floor. Suddenly a stone falls from the ceiling and smashes the skull to pieces.
Dozens of dead, winged beings lie scattered about the floor, each about the size of a cat. Their broken bodies are batlike and buglike at the same time.
